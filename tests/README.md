# FHIR API Test Suite

Comprehensive test suite for validating FHIR API examples from the documentation.

## Overview

This test suite validates all sample queries, searches, and CRUD operations documented in:
- `organization-management.md`
- `practitioner-practitionerrole-management.md`
- `patient-registration.md`

## Features

- ✅ Tests all documented search parameters
- ✅ Tests CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- ✅ Tests positive cases (should find results)
- ✅ Tests negative cases (should not find results)
- ✅ Tests duplicate detection and patient matching logic
- ✅ Configurable for different server environments
- ✅ Colored output for easy result reading
- ✅ **Full JSON responses with syntax highlighting**
- ✅ **Highlights relevant fields being tested**
- ✅ Comprehensive test reporting

## Requirements

```bash
pip install requests
```

## Configuration

The test suite can be configured using environment variables:

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `FHIR_BASE_URL` | FHIR server base URL | `https://playground.dhp.uz/fhir` |
| `CLEANUP_AFTER_TESTS` | Delete test resources after running | `false` |
| `VERBOSE` | Show detailed request/response logs | `true` |
| `INTERACTIVE` | Pause after each test for manual validation | `false` |
| `REQUEST_TIMEOUT` | HTTP request timeout in seconds | `30` |
| `TEST_IDENTIFIER_PREFIX` | Prefix for test identifiers | `test-` |

## Usage

### Run All Tests

```bash
cd tests
python run_all_tests.py
# Or explicitly:
python run_all_tests.py all
```

### Run Specific Scenarios

You can run individual scenarios or combine them:

```bash
# Run single scenario (full name)
python run_all_tests.py organization
python run_all_tests.py practitioner
python run_all_tests.py patient

# Run single scenario (short name)
python run_all_tests.py org
python run_all_tests.py pract
python run_all_tests.py pat

# Run multiple scenarios
python run_all_tests.py org patient
python run_all_tests.py pract org

# See available options
python run_all_tests.py --help
```

### Run Individual Test Files Directly

You can also run test files directly without the wrapper:

```bash
# Organization tests only
python test_organization.py

# Practitioner/PractitionerRole tests only
python test_practitioner.py

# Patient registration tests only
python test_patient.py
```

### Run Against Different Server

```bash
# Test against playground server (default)
python run_all_tests.py

# Test against production server
FHIR_BASE_URL=https://fhir.dhp.uz python run_all_tests.py

# Test against local development server
FHIR_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080/fhir python run_all_tests.py
```

### Enable Cleanup

By default, test resources are NOT deleted. To enable cleanup:

```bash
CLEANUP_AFTER_TESTS=true python run_all_tests.py
```

### Interactive Mode

To step through tests one at a time (pauses after each test):

```bash
INTERACTIVE=true python run_all_tests.py
```

This is useful for:
- Manual validation of each test result
- Debugging specific test failures
- Understanding what each test does
- Inspecting server responses carefully

Press Enter to advance to the next test, or Ctrl+C to stop.

### Quiet Mode

To reduce output verbosity:

```bash
VERBOSE=false python run_all_tests.py
```

### Combined Example

```bash
FHIR_BASE_URL=https://fhir.dhp.uz \
CLEANUP_AFTER_TESTS=true \
VERBOSE=false \
python run_all_tests.py
```

## Test Coverage

### Organization Tests (14 tests)
- Search by soliq ID
- Search by name (partial and exact)
- Search by type
- Search active organizations
- Combined search parameters (AND logic)
- Multiple values (OR logic)
- Search departments by partof
- Create organization
- Read organization by ID
- Update organization with optimistic locking
- Delete organization
- Negative: Read non-existent organization
- Negative: Search non-existent organization
- Negative: Update without If-Match header

### Practitioner/PractitionerRole Tests (23 tests)
- Search by ARGOS identifier
- Search by name, given name, family name
- Search by phone and email
- Search by address city

### Patient Registration Tests (24 tests)
- Search by PINFL identifier
- Search by name, given name, family name

## Output

The test suite provides colored output with full JSON responses:
- ✓ Green: Test passed
- ✗ Red: Test failed
- ⊘ Yellow: Test skipped
- 🔵 Blue: HTTP requests/responses
- 🔷 Cyan: Highlighted fields being tested

### Features
- **Full JSON responses**: No truncation, see complete server responses
- **Syntax highlighting**: Color-coded JSON for readability
- **Field highlighting**: Relevant fields being tested are highlighted in cyan/green
- **Resource counts**: Shows number of resources found in search results

Example output:
```
=== Organization Tests ===

Search Tests
✓ Search organization by soliq ID
✓ Search organization by name (partial)
✓ Search organization by exact name
...

Test Summary
============================================================
Passed:  12
Failed:  0
Skipped: 2
Total:   14

✓ All tests passed!
```

## CI/CD Integration

Exit codes:
- `0`: All tests passed
- `1`: One or more tests failed

Example usage in CI:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e

# Run tests against staging
FHIR_BASE_URL=https://staging.dhp.uz/fhir \
CLEANUP_AFTER_TESTS=true \
python tests/run_all_tests.py

# If tests pass, deploy to production
./deploy.sh
```

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Errors
If you get connection errors, check:
1. Base URL is correct and accessible
2. Network connectivity
3. Firewall/proxy settings
4. Request timeout settings

### Test Failures
If tests fail:
1. Check server is running and accessible
2. Verify server has expected test data
3. Check server version matches documentation
4. Review verbose output for details

### Resource Cleanup
If you want to manually clean up test resources:
```bash
# Find test resources (they all have TEST_IDENTIFIER_PREFIX)
curl "https://playground.dhp.uz/fhir/Patient?name=test-"

# Delete manually or use CLEANUP_AFTER_TESTS=true
```

## Contributing

When adding new documentation examples:
1. Add corresponding test cases to appropriate test file
2. Include both positive and negative test cases
3. Update this README with new test coverage
4. Run full test suite to ensure no regressions
